FaceFlip
========

### FaceFlip is a CamTwist effect plugin that uses face tracking to flip faces upside down. ###

It was created as a class project for Golan Levin's [Special Topics in Interactive Art & Computational Design](http://golancourses.net/2010spring/03/15/faceflip/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I use it to freak people out on ChatRoulette.

[Check out this video](http://vimeo.com/10191761) to see it in action.
